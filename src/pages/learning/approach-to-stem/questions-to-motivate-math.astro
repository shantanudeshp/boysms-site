				<h1>Questions to Motivate Math</h1>

				<div class="content">
					<h2>Ratios, rates, fractions, percentages</h2>

					<h3>Q1</h3>
					<p>McDonald's makes drinks out of concentrate. They have two types of drink: Dr. Pepper and Coke.</p>
					<p>The Dr. Pepper concentrate says "Mix 1 part concentrate with 5 parts water". The Coke concentrate says "Mix 2 parts concentrate with 5 parts water".</p>
					<p>McDonald's has a drinks machine with 2 containers of size 50 gallons for each container.</p>

					<p><strong>1></strong> In the morning, the containers are empty. How should the employee in charge of the drinks fill them up?</p>
					<p><strong>2></strong> The containers are now almost empty. They show 2 gallons left in each. How should the employee refill the containers?</p>
					<p><strong>3> [Advanced]</strong> Different McDonald's have different sized drinks containers to dispense the drinks. Customers are complaining that the drinks taste different in different McDonald's, and sometimes they taste different even in the same McDonald's!!</p>
					<p>Come up with a solution to solve this problem.</p>

					<h3>Q2</h3>
					<p>A Tesla can go at a top speed of 80 mph. A Porsche can go at a top speed of 100 mph.</p>
					<p>They start at different ends of a straight road 400 miles long.</p>

					<p><strong>1></strong> When and where will they crash into each other?</p>
					<p><strong>2></strong> What if they both went twice as fast? When and where would they crash into each other?</p>
					<p><strong>3></strong> Now we have lots of different cars, bicycles and motorcycles. They all have different top speeds.</p>
					<p>You have to write a python program that takes the speeds of any two vehicles, and output the time and place that they will crash.</p>

					<h2>Exponents</h2>

					<h3>Double XP weekend that gets ridiculous fast</h3>
					<p>You're playing a game with a special event: your XP <strong>doubles every level</strong>.<br>
					Start: 25 XP at level 0.<br>
					The XP doubles at every level.</p>

					<p>Ask them live:</p>
					<p><strong>1></strong> "Level 1, level 2, level 5—what happens if we keep doubling?"</p>
					<p><strong>2></strong> "Write a rule for level n. Don't worry about fancy symbols at first—just say it in English."</p>
					<p><strong>3></strong> Twist: "How many levels until we hit 20,000 XP? Are you surprised?"</p>
					<p><strong>4></strong> Level-up: "If we triple each level instead, how does your rule change?"</p>

					<h2>Statistics and probability</h2>

					<h3>Q1: Simple Card games</h3>
					<p>We will play some fun card games. Card games can be complicated. But after introducing the kids to card games, we will use simplified games (like War) and work on calculating probability.</p>

					<h3>Q2: Who is the best?</h3>
					<p>Example: Who is the best hitter in baseball?</p>
					<p>Put together your case for the best hitter in baseball. We want to have objective criteria.</p>
					<p>What do the statistics mean? Why are they designed the way they are?</p>
